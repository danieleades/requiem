# Requirement File Format

Requiem requirements are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter. This chapter explains the format in detail.

## File Structure

A requirement file has three parts:

1. **YAML Frontmatter** - Metadata enclosed in `---` delimiters
2. **HRID Title** - The HRID as the first token in the first markdown heading
3. **Markdown Body** - The requirement text

### Example

```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: 4bfeb7d5-d168-44a7-b0f1-e292c1c89b9a
created: 2025-07-22T12:19:56.950194157Z
parents:
- uuid: 3fc6800c-5acc-457e-baf9-a29b42b663fd
  fingerprint: c4020419ead000e9b5f9cfd4ebf6192e73f905c27e6897548d8f6e12fd7f1356
  hrid: USR-001
---
# SYS-001 Email Validation

The system shall validate user email addresses according to RFC 5322.

Email validation must occur before account creation.
```

## HRID in Title

**Important**: The HRID (Human-Readable ID) must appear as the first token in the first markdown heading:

```markdown
# USR-001 Plain Text Storage
# SYS-042 Email Validation System
# AUTH-LOGIN-SYS-001 Password Hashing
```

**Key points**:
- The HRID is the first token (word) in the heading
- Followed by a space and then the title text
- The HRID is NOT in the YAML frontmatter
- This format ensures compatibility with Sphinx and MdBook

**Why this matters**: This change was made to improve compatibility with documentation tools like Sphinx and MdBook, which can use the heading as the page title naturally.

## YAML Frontmatter

The frontmatter contains structured metadata.

### Required Fields

#### `_version`

```yaml
_version: '1'
```

**Purpose**: Format version for future compatibility.

**Value**: Currently always `'1'` (quoted string).

**Why it matters**: If Requiem's file format evolves, this field allows newer versions to handle older files correctly.

#### `uuid`

```yaml
uuid: 4bfeb7d5-d168-44a7-b0f1-e292c1c89b9a
```

**Purpose**: Globally unique, stable identifier.

**Value**: UUIDv4 (automatically generated by `req add`).

**Why it matters**: This never changes, even if the requirement is renumbered. Parent-child relationships use UUIDs, ensuring links remain valid.

#### `created`

```yaml
created: 2025-07-22T12:19:56.950194157Z
```

**Purpose**: Timestamp of requirement creation.

**Value**: ISO 8601 format with timezone (always UTC).

**Why it matters**: Provides audit trail and helps understand requirement evolution.

### Optional Fields

#### `parents`

```yaml
parents:
- uuid: 3fc6800c-5acc-457e-baf9-a29b42b663fd
  fingerprint: c4020419ead000e9b5f9cfd4ebf6192e73f905c27e6897548d8f6e12fd7f1356
  hrid: USR-001
- uuid: 7a8f9e2b-1c3d-4e5f-6a7b-8c9d0e1f2a3b
  fingerprint: a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456
  hrid: USR-003
```

**Purpose**: Links to parent (upstream) requirements.

**Value**: List of parent objects, each containing:
- `uuid` - Parent's stable identifier
- `fingerprint` - SHA256 hash of parent's content
- `hrid` - Parent's human-readable ID (for convenience)

**Why it matters**: Establishes traceability. Multiple parents are supported.

**Note**: This field is absent if the requirement has no parents (e.g., top-level user requirements).

#### `tags` (planned)

```yaml
tags:
- security
- authentication
- high-priority
```

**Purpose**: Categorize and filter requirements.

**Status**: The data structure supports tags, but there are no CLI commands to manage them yet. You can manually add tags to the YAML.

**Future**: Commands like `req tag add USR-001 security` will manage tags.

## Markdown Body

The body contains the actual requirement text, written in Markdown.

### Best Practices

#### Use Clear Language

```markdown
# Good
The system shall validate email addresses before account creation.

# Less clear
Email validation is performed.
```

Use "shall" for mandatory requirements, "should" for recommended, "may" for optional.

#### One Concept Per Requirement

```markdown
# Bad (multiple concepts)
The system shall validate emails and passwords and usernames.

# Good (split into separate requirements)
# USR-001.md
The system shall validate email addresses.

# USR-002.md
The system shall validate passwords for minimum strength.

# USR-003.md
The system shall validate usernames for uniqueness.
```

#### Be Testable

```markdown
# Bad (not testable)
The system shall be fast.

# Good (testable)
The system shall respond to login requests within 200ms at the 95th percentile.
```

#### Include Context

```markdown
The system shall hash passwords using bcrypt with a cost factor of 12.

Rationale: Bcrypt is resistant to GPU-based attacks. Cost factor 12 provides
security while maintaining acceptable login performance (< 200ms).
```

### Markdown Features

You can use any Markdown syntax:

#### Headings

The first heading must contain the HRID. Subsequent headings are free-form:

```markdown
# USR-001 User Authentication

## Rationale

The requirement exists because...

## Acceptance Criteria

- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2
```

#### Lists

```markdown
The system shall support the following authentication methods:

1. Username and password
2. OAuth (Google, GitHub)
3. SAML SSO
```

#### Code Blocks

```markdown
Example API response:

\`\`\`json
{
  "user_id": "4bfeb7d5-d168-44a7-b0f1-e292c1c89b9a",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
\`\`\`
```

#### Emphasis

```markdown
The system **shall** validate emails. It *should* provide helpful error messages.
```

## Filename Convention

Filenames must match the requirement's HRID:

```
USR-001.md
SYS-042.md
COMPONENT-SUBCOMPONENT-SWR-123.md
```

**Case sensitive**: `USR-001.md` and `usr-001.md` are different files (though the latter won't be recognized as a requirement).

**Extension**: Must be `.md`.

**HRID Consistency**: The HRID in the filename should match the HRID in the first heading. For example, `USR-001.md` should contain `# USR-001 Title`. The filename is authoritative for determining the HRID.

If the filename doesn't match the HRID format, Requiem will:
- Ignore the file (if `allow_unrecognised = true` in config)
- Return an error (if `allow_unrecognised = false`, the default)

## Parsing Rules

### Frontmatter Delimiters

The YAML frontmatter must:
- Start with `---` on the first line
- End with `---` on a line by itself
- Contain valid YAML

```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: 4bfeb7d5-d168-44a7-b0f1-e292c1c89b9a
created: 2025-07-22T12:19:56.950194157Z
---

Requirement text here...
```

### Whitespace

- Leading/trailing whitespace in the body is preserved
- Empty lines between frontmatter and body are ignored

```markdown
---
...frontmatter...
---


This is the first line of the body (empty lines above are ignored).
```

## Editing Requirements

### Manual Editing

You can edit requirements with any text editor:

```bash
vim USR-001.md
code SYS-042.md
nano TST-003.md
```

**Caution**: Don't modify the `uuid` field! This would break traceability.

**Safe to edit**:
- The markdown body (requirement text)
- Tags (if present)

**Requiem manages** (don't edit manually):
- `created` timestamp
- Parent `fingerprint` fields (updated by linking commands)

### Using Scripts

Since requirements are plain text, you can process them with scripts:

```python
# Add a tag to all USR requirements
import re
import glob

for filename in glob.glob("USR-*.md"):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Add tag to frontmatter
    content = content.replace(
        "---\n",
        "---\ntags:\n- user-facing\n",
        1  # Only first occurrence
    )

    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)
```

**Caution**: Ensure scripts preserve YAML validity. Invalid YAML will cause parsing errors.

## Validation

Requiem validates requirements when loading:

```bash
req clean  # Loads all requirements, reports errors
```

Common validation errors:

- **Invalid YAML**: Syntax errors in frontmatter
- **Missing required fields**: No `uuid`, `created`, or `_version`
- **Invalid UUID**: Malformed UUID string
- **Invalid timestamp**: Malformed ISO 8601 date
- **Duplicate UUIDs**: Two requirements with the same UUID (serious error!)

## File Format Evolution

The `_version` field allows future format changes:

**Version 1** (current):
- Fields: `_version`, `uuid`, `created`, `parents`, `tags`
- Parents include UUID, fingerprint, and HRID

**Version 2** (hypothetical future):
- Might add: `status`, `priority`, `owner`
- Older Requiem versions can still read V1 files

## Real-World Examples

Want to see actual requirement files following this format? Browse the [Example Project](../requirements.md) which contains 21 real requirements used by Requiem itself:

- [USR-001: Plain Text Storage](../requirements/USR-001.md) - Simple user requirement
- [SYS-001: Markdown File Format with YAML Frontmatter](../requirements/SYS-001.md) - System requirement with parent link

These demonstrate the file format in practice with proper frontmatter, parent links, and well-structured content.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the file format, learn about [Human-Readable IDs (HRIDs)](./hrids.md) and their syntax rules.
