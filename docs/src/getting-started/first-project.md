# Your First Requirements Project

In this chapter, we'll build a complete requirements hierarchy for a simple project: a task management application. You'll learn how to structure requirements across multiple levels and establish traceability.

## Planning the Hierarchy

A typical requirements hierarchy has multiple levels:

1. **User Requirements (USR)** - High-level needs from the user's perspective
2. **System Requirements (SYS)** - Technical specifications that satisfy user needs
3. **Software Requirements (SWR)** - Detailed implementation requirements (optional)
4. **Test Requirements (TST)** - Test cases that verify requirements (optional)

For our task app, we'll use USR and SYS levels.

## Setting Up the Project

Create and enter a new directory:

```bash
mkdir task-app-requirements
cd task-app-requirements
```

## Creating User Requirements

User requirements describe what users need, not how it's implemented.

```bash
req add USR  # USR-001
req add USR  # USR-002
req add USR  # USR-003
```

Edit each file to add content:

**USR-001.md:**
```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: <auto-generated>
created: <auto-generated>
---
# USR-001 Create Tasks

Users shall be able to create tasks with a title and description.
```

**USR-002.md:**
```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: <auto-generated>
created: <auto-generated>
---
# USR-002 Mark Tasks Complete

Users shall be able to mark tasks as complete.
```

**USR-003.md:**
```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: <auto-generated>
created: <auto-generated>
---
# USR-003 Filter Tasks

Users shall be able to filter tasks by completion status.
```

## Creating System Requirements

System requirements break down user requirements into technical specifications.

For `USR-001` (creating tasks), we need:

```bash
req add SYS --parents USR-001  # SYS-001
req add SYS --parents USR-001  # SYS-002
```

**SYS-001.md:**
```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: <auto-generated>
created: <auto-generated>
parents:
- uuid: <USR-001 uuid>
  fingerprint: <auto-generated>
  hrid: USR-001
---
# SYS-001 Task Data Structure

The system shall provide a Task data structure with fields: id, title, description, completed, created_at.
```

**SYS-002.md:**
```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: <auto-generated>
created: <auto-generated>
parents:
- uuid: <USR-001 uuid>
  fingerprint: <auto-generated>
  hrid: USR-001
---
# SYS-002 Task Title Validation

The system shall validate that task titles are non-empty strings with maximum 100 characters.
```

For `USR-002` (marking complete):

```bash
req add SYS --parents USR-002  # SYS-003
```

**SYS-003.md:**
```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: <auto-generated>
created: <auto-generated>
parents:
- uuid: <USR-002 uuid>
  fingerprint: <auto-generated>
  hrid: USR-002
---
# SYS-003 Toggle Task Completion

The system shall provide a method to toggle the completed status of a task.
```

For `USR-003` (filtering):

```bash
req add SYS --parents USR-003  # SYS-004
```

**SYS-004.md:**
```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: <auto-generated>
created: <auto-generated>
parents:
- uuid: <USR-003 uuid>
  fingerprint: <auto-generated>
  hrid: USR-003
---
# SYS-004 Filter Tasks by Status

The system shall provide a method to filter tasks returning only those matching the specified completion status.
```

## Creating Cross-Cutting Requirements

Some requirements affect multiple user needs. For example, persistence:

```bash
req add SYS --parents USR-001,USR-002,USR-003  # SYS-005
```

**SYS-005.md:**
```markdown
---
_version: '1'
uuid: <auto-generated>
created: <auto-generated>
parents:
- uuid: <USR-001 uuid>
  fingerprint: <auto-generated>
  hrid: USR-001
- uuid: <USR-002 uuid>
  fingerprint: <auto-generated>
  hrid: USR-002
- uuid: <USR-003 uuid>
  fingerprint: <auto-generated>
  hrid: USR-003
---
# SYS-005 Task Persistence

The system shall persist all tasks to disk and load them on startup.
```

This requirement has three parents because it affects creating, completing, and filtering tasks.

## Reviewing Your Requirements Structure

Your directory now contains:

```
task-app-requirements/
├── USR-001.md  (Create tasks)
├── USR-002.md  (Mark complete)
├── USR-003.md  (Filter tasks)
├── SYS-001.md  → USR-001 (Task data structure)
├── SYS-002.md  → USR-001 (Title validation)
├── SYS-003.md  → USR-002 (Toggle completed)
├── SYS-004.md  → USR-003 (Filter method)
└── SYS-005.md  → USR-001, USR-002, USR-003 (Persistence)
```

## Version Control Integration

Requirements are plain text, so they work great with Git:

```bash
git init
git add *.md
git commit -m "Initial requirements for task management app"
```

Every requirement change will now show up in your Git history with clear diffs:

```diff
--- a/USR-001.md
+++ b/USR-001.md
@@ -4,4 +4,4 @@
 created: 2025-07-22T12:19:56.950194157Z
 ---

-Users shall be able to create tasks with a title and description.
+Users shall be able to create tasks with a title, description, and due date.
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated

This example shows several best practices:

1. **Start high-level** - Begin with user requirements before diving into technical details
2. **One concept per requirement** - Each requirement addresses a single, testable concept
3. **Use clear language** - Requirements use "shall" to indicate mandatory behavior
4. **Establish traceability** - Every system requirement traces to at least one user requirement
5. **Support multiple parents** - Cross-cutting concerns can satisfy multiple needs
