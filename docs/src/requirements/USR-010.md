# USR-010 Repository Validation and Health

## Statement

The tool shall provide a unified CLI command for validating repository health and integrity across all requirements.

## Rationale

Requirements repositories can become inconsistent through several mechanisms:
- Manual file editing that breaks frontmatter structure
- File moves that don't update paths
- Deletions that leave dangling references
- Circular dependencies that violate DAG constraints
- HRID collisions from copy-paste or merges

Currently, validation is scattered across multiple commands (status, suspect, diagnose), making it unclear where to check for problems. Users need a single command that comprehensively validates the repository and reports all issues with actionable guidance.

This is especially important for:
- **CI/CD:** Pipelines need one command to gate on
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Quick validation before committing
- **Repository audits:** Finding all problems at once
- **Migrations:** Validating after bulk operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- A single command runs all validation checks (structure, paths, links, fingerprints)
- Users can run specific checks independently (--check paths, --check links, etc.)
- The command reports all issues found, not just the first one
- Exit codes communicate validation status for automation
- The command includes auto-fix capability (--fix) for safe repairs
- Output supports both human-readable and machine-readable formats
