# Suspect Links CLI Command

## Statement

The tool shall provide a CLI command `req suspect` that lists all suspect links in the requirement graph.

## Scope

The command exposes suspect relationships so engineers can review upstream changes and decide on remediation. The experience shall support both quick interactive scans and scripted checks in CI.

Detailed interaction, messaging, and presentation are defined in [SPC-001](./SPC-001.md).

## Verification

- Running the command surfaces every suspect link produced by the detection engine.
- Output allows operators to identify the child and parent involved in each suspect relationship.
- Exit status communicates whether the repository still contains suspect links.
