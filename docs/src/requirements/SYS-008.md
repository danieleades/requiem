# Suspect Links CLI Command

## Statement

The tool shall provide a CLI command `req suspect` that lists all suspect links in the requirement graph.

## Implementation Notes

Command behavior:
- Scans all requirements for suspect parent links
- Displays child HRID and suspect parent HRID for each suspect link
- Shows stored fingerprint vs. current fingerprint for debugging
- Exits with non-zero status if suspect links found (CI integration)
- Exits with zero status if no suspect links found
- Output format supports both human reading and scripting

## Verification

- Command correctly identifies all suspect links
- Command output shows child and parent HRIDs clearly
- Exit code is 0 when no suspect links exist
- Exit code is non-zero when suspect links exist
- Command runs quickly (< 1 second for typical projects)
