# Listing Filters and Scopes

## Statement

The `req list` command shall support filters that limit results by structural, categorical, or textual criteria without requiring additional scripting.

## Rationale

Large projects routinely ask focused questions: “Show me the SYS requirements under USR-004”, “List everything owned by the security namespace”, or “Find requirements mentioning ‘latency’”. Native filters keep those workflows fast, repeatable, and reviewer-friendly.

## Scope

Filtering transforms the listing command from a static report into an investigative tool. The experience shall make it obvious how to focus by kind, namespace, tags, graph position, or free text while keeping the syntax memorable at the keyboard.

Full filter catalogue, composition rules, and discoverability aids are captured in [SPC-002](./SPC-002.md).

## Verification

- Users filter by kind, namespace, graph position, or content without creating a custom script.
- Filters can be combined so the result set respects every supplied constraint.
- Pagination and batching allow large repositories to remain manageable.
