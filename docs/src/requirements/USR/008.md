# USR-008 Directory Organization Flexibility

## Statement

The tool shall support multiple directory organization strategies to accommodate different project structures and workflows.

## Rationale

Different teams and projects have varying preferences for organizing requirements files:
- Some prefer flat directory structures for simplicity
- Others need hierarchical organization with namespace folders
- Projects may need to migrate between structures as they grow
- Integration with existing documentation may require specific layouts

Providing configurable directory modes allows teams to adopt Requiem without restructuring their existing documentation, while still maintaining all traceability and tooling benefits.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Configuration option exists to choose directory organization mode
- Path-based mode supported (namespace folders like `auth/USR/001.md`)
- Filename-based mode supported (flat structure like `auth-USR-001.md`)
- Clear documentation of each mode's structure and tradeoffs
- Migration path documented between modes
- `req sync` command can check and fix path-related issues
- Both modes maintain full traceability and parent-child relationships
