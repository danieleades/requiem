# Requirement Relationships and Traceability

## Statement

The tool shall support parent-child relationships between requirements, enabling traceability from high-level user needs down to detailed specifications.

## Rationale

Traceability relationships enable:
- Verification that all user needs are addressed by lower-level requirements
- Impact analysis when requirements change
- Coverage reporting to ensure completeness
- Support for multiple parents to handle cross-cutting concerns (e.g., security requirements affecting multiple features)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Requirements can declare one or more parent requirements
- Parent-child relationships form a directed graph
- Relationships are bidirectional (can traverse up and down)
- Multiple parents are supported for cross-cutting requirements
- Relationship changes are tracked and detectable
