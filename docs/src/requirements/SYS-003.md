# Parent Requirement Links

## Statement

Requirements shall declare parent requirements in their YAML frontmatter as a list of parent references containing UUID, HRID, and fingerprint.

## Implementation Notes

- Parents stored as YAML list in frontmatter
- Each parent entry contains:
  - `uuid`: Parent's unique identifier (for resolution)
  - `hrid`: Parent's human-readable ID (for display/reference)
  - `fingerprint`: SHA256 hash of parent content (for change detection)
- Multiple parents supported for cross-cutting concerns
- Tool validates all referenced parent UUIDs exist in the repository

## Verification

- Tool successfully parses parent links from frontmatter
- Tool resolves parent UUIDs to requirement objects
- Tool reports error for non-existent parent UUIDs
- Multiple parents per requirement are supported
- Parent links are bidirectionally navigable
