# SYS-025 Move Requirement Command

## Statement

The tool shall provide a 'req move' command that moves requirements to new paths while maintaining HRID consistency.

## Scope

This command handles file relocation within the repository. When moving a requirement:
- File is moved to new location
- If path implies HRID change, first markdown heading is updated
- Optional --sync flag updates children's parent references

Supports both path mode and filename mode repositories.

## Verification

- Command moves file to specified path
- HRID extracted from new path is updated in markdown heading if changed
- --sync flag triggers update of children parent HRIDs
- --yes flag skips confirmation prompts
- Validation prevents HRID conflicts
- Creates necessary directories automatically
