# SYS-007 MdBook Compatibility

## Statement

Requirement files shall be compatible with MdBook static site generator and can be included in MdBook-generated documentation.

## Rationale

MdBook is popular for creating technical books and documentation, especially in the Rust community. Its simple, book-like structure with chapter organization makes it ideal for requirements documentation. Compatibility with MdBook enables requirements to be published as readable, navigable books with search functionality and a clean reading experience, making requirements accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Implementation Notes

- MdBook uses CommonMark Markdown
- Requirements can be transcluded using `{{#include}}` preprocessor
- YAML frontmatter must not break MdBook rendering
- Markdown body renders correctly in MdBook HTML output
- Requirements integrate with MdBook chapter structure

## Verification

- Requirement files render correctly in MdBook-generated books
- YAML frontmatter doesn't cause MdBook errors or rendering issues
- Transcluded requirements via `{{#include}}` work correctly
- Generated MdBook site includes requirement content with proper formatting
- Requirements can be organized into MdBook chapters
