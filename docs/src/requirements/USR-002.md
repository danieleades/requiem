# Unique and Stable Identifiers

## Statement

Each requirement shall have both a UUID (for machine processing and stable references) and a human-readable ID (HRID) for human communication.

## Rationale

Dual identifiers provide:
- **UUID**: Globally unique, stable across renames, enables reliable programmatic reference
- **HRID**: Human-friendly (e.g., USR-001), easy to discuss and remember
- Prevents broken references when requirements are reorganized
- Supports both automation and human workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every requirement has a unique UUID that never changes
- Every requirement has an HRID in format `{KIND}-{NUMBER}` (e.g., USR-001)
- UUIDs are used internally for linking and reference resolution
- HRIDs are displayed to users for communication and documentation
- Both identifiers are preserved during requirement lifecycle
