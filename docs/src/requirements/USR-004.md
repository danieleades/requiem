# Graph Analysis and Validation

## Statement

The tool shall analyze the directed graph of requirement relationships to detect structural issues and identify requirements that need review when dependencies change.

## Rationale

Graph analysis capabilities provide:
- Detection of cycles (which violate requirement hierarchy principles)
- Identification of orphaned or disconnected requirements
- Change impact analysis to find affected downstream requirements
- Automated detection of suspicious or invalid relationships
- Quality assurance for requirement structure

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tool detects and reports cycles in the requirement graph
- Tool identifies requirements that need review when parents change (suspect links)
- Tool can traverse the graph to find all descendants of a requirement
- Tool provides commands to analyze graph structure and health
- Analysis is fast enough for interactive use (< 1 second for typical projects)
