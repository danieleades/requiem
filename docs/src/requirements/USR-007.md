# USR-007 Requirement Visibility and Navigation

## Statement

The tool shall let users quickly locate, inspect, and summarize requirements from the command line without opening individual files.

## Rationale

Systems engineers need to answer high-level questions during reviews and day-to-day work:
- Which requirements exist for a given domain, kind, or tag?
- What is the coverage of parents, children, and affected downstream items?
- Are there orphaned or unimplemented requirements that need action?
- What summaries can we hand to stakeholders without post-processing raw files?

Command-line visibility removes friction when preparing release packages, running audits, or doing change impact analysis, especially when the requirements set spans hundreds of artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A CLI workflow exists to enumerate requirements with key metadata (HRID, title, kind, parent/child counts).
- Users can scope the listing by HRID, kind, namespace, tag, or search phrase.
- Users can pivot the listing around a specific requirement to see parents, children, ancestors, or descendants.
- Listings support at least one machine-readable output format to enable scripting and report generation.
- The listing functionality operates on the same repository-based storage without requiring external services.
