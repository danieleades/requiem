# SYS-006 Sphinx and MyST Parser Compatibility

## Statement

Requirement files shall be compatible with Sphinx documentation generator using the MyST (Markedly Structured Text) parser.

## Rationale

Sphinx is widely used for technical documentation, especially in Python projects and large documentation systems. MyST extends Sphinx with Markdown support while maintaining reStructuredText's power. Compatibility with Sphinx enables requirements to be seamlessly integrated into project documentation, API references, and technical manuals, ensuring requirements are accessible alongside design documentation and implementation guides.

## Implementation Notes

- MyST parser supports Markdown with extended syntax
- YAML frontmatter must not break Sphinx rendering
- Requirements can be transcluded using `{include}` directive
- Markdown body renders correctly in Sphinx HTML output
- Internal links between requirements preserve functionality

## Verification

- Requirement files render correctly in Sphinx-generated documentation
- YAML frontmatter is ignored or handled gracefully by MyST parser
- Transcluded requirements maintain formatting and links
- Generated Sphinx site includes requirement content
- Cross-references between requirements work in Sphinx output
