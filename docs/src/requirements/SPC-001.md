# Suspect Link Remediation CLI Specification

## Purpose

Provide a cohesive terminal experience that helps engineers notice, inspect, and resolve suspect links with confidence, whether they are investigating a single change or sweeping a backlog after a review cycle.

## Experience Principles

- **Clarity first:** Highlight child → parent relationships in a consistent, column-aligned layout with subtle colour (when available) and unambiguous labels.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Offer terse summaries by default, then reveal fingerprints or paths only when users request extra context.
- **Guardrails:** Make irreversible actions deliberate through confirmations, dry-runs, and exit codes that play well with automation.
- **Speed:** Ensure commands feel instantaneous on the happy path (no unnecessary prompts, minimal chatter).

## Command Behaviours

### `req suspect`

- Default output is a compact table: `CHILD  PARENT  STATUS`, sorted by child HRID. The `STATUS` column shows a short diagnosis (`fingerprint drift`, `parent missing`, etc.).
- `--detail` expands each row into a block that adds stored vs. current fingerprints plus the parent file path. Blocks are separated by thin dashed rules for scanability.
- `--format json|ndjson` mirrors the table data. JSON keys: `child`, `parent`, `status`, `stored_fingerprint`, `current_fingerprint`, `child_path`, `parent_path`.
- When no suspect links remain, print `✅ No suspect links detected.` and exit with `0`.
- When suspect links exist, exit with `2` and keep stderr quiet so table output is script-friendly.

### `req accept <child> <parent>`

- Before writing, present a confirmation banner summarising the link:
  ```
  Reviewing: CHILD → PARENT
  Stored:    <hash>
  Current:   <hash>
  ```
- Prompt: `Accept this link? (y/N)` with uppercase default to reduce accidental confirmation. `--yes` skips the prompt.
- On success, print `Accepted CHILD ← PARENT` in green (fallback to plain text when colours are disabled).
- If the link is not suspect, warn: `No changes: link already up-to-date.` and exit with `0`.
- Unknown relationships fail with exit code `64` (usage error) and message `Unable to find parent PARENT for child CHILD`.

### `req accept --all`

- Always begin with a dry-run preview when no explicit mode is chosen. Show a summary table:
  ```
  Pending updates: 24 suspect links
  Use --apply to write changes.
  ```
- Flags:
  - `--dry-run` (default) prints the list and exits `0`.
  - `--apply` performs the write path.
  - `--yes` (or `--force`) skips the confirmation prompt that appears before writing.
- Confirmation copy: `Apply updates to 24 suspect links across 10 files? (y/N)`
- During apply, stream progress as `Updating CHILD ← PARENT`. On completion, show a compact recap (`Links updated: 24 | Files touched: 10 | Duration: 0.9s`).
- Exit codes: `0` on success, `2` if suspect links remain after the command (e.g., when run in dry-run mode), `70` for IO failures.

## Accessibility & Ergonomics

- Follow no-colour environment variables (`NO_COLOR`, `CLICOLOR=0`) and provide readable monochrome output.
- Table layouts use spaces, not tabs, so alignment is predictable across shells.
- Prompts treat EOF (Ctrl-D) as “cancel” and exit with code `130`, mirroring interrupted commands.
- Messages avoid gendered language, use sentence case, and keep line width ≤ 80 characters.

## Empty-State & Error Messaging

- Empty preview (`req accept --all --dry-run` with nothing to do) returns: `Nothing to update. All suspect links are already accepted.` plus exit `0`.
- If the graph cannot be loaded, display `Unable to read requirements. See logs above.` and exit `70`.
- Validation errors refer to HRIDs, not internal UUIDs, so engineers can locate files quickly.
