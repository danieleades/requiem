# Relationship Navigation Views

## Statement

The `req list` command shall expose relationship-focused views that make it easy to inspect parents, children, ancestors, and descendants of selected requirements.

## Rationale

Impact analysis and review prep require seeing the neighborhood around a requirement: upstream drivers, downstream implementations, and gaps such as missing children. Navigating that context inside the CLI keeps engineers in their workflow and avoids context switching.

## CLI Interface

- `--view parents` lists the immediate parents of each target HRID (either supplied positionally
  or via filters). When no targets are specified, the command prints parent links for all
  requirements.
- `--view children` lists immediate children; pair with `--depth <N>` to traverse further
  descendants (`--depth 1` by default, `--depth 0` for unlimited).
- `--view ancestors` and `--view descendants` walk the full graph depth (default unlimited, honour
  `--depth` when provided).
- `--view tree` renders an indented descendant view rooted at the specified HRID(s), showing link
  direction downward. Tree output includes the HRID and title on each line.
- `--view context` augments the base listing with labelled parent (`↑`) and child (`↓`) rows up to
  the requested depth (`--depth 1` default).
- When combined with filters (e.g., `req list USR-004 --view descendants --kind SYS`), traversal
  applies first, then filters trim the displayed nodes.

## Verification

- `req list USR-004 --view children` displays all immediate system requirements linked to USR-004.
- `req list SYS-003 --view ancestors` produces a list containing SYS-003 and its upstream lineage ending at user requirements.
- `req list USR-004 --view tree --depth 2` renders a two-level descendant tree.
- `req list --orphans --view parents` shows that orphaned requirements have no parents (empty results).
- Combined filters and traversal (`req list USR-001 --view descendants --kind TST`) return only TEST requirements downstream of USR-001.
