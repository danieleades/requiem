# Suspect Link Detection

## Statement

The tool shall track "suspect links" by comparing the fingerprint stored in a child requirement against the current content fingerprint of its parent requirement.

## Implementation Notes

- A link is "suspect" when stored fingerprint â‰  current parent fingerprint
- Indicates parent has been modified since link was created/reviewed
- Child requirements with suspect links need manual review
- Fingerprints use SHA256 hash of parent content
- Tool computes current fingerprint on-demand for comparison

## Verification

- Tool correctly identifies suspect links after parent modifications
- Tool does not flag links when parent content unchanged
- Tool handles multiple parents (checks each independently)
- Fingerprint comparison is accurate and reliable
- Suspect links are clearly reported with child and parent HRIDs
