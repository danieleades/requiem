# Status Dashboard CLI Command

## Statement

The tool shall provide a `req status` command that prints a simple table of requirement counts by kind and reports the number of suspect links.

## Rationale

Systems engineers need a quick snapshot before reviews, releases, or CI runs. A single command that surfaces totals, traceability gaps (roots/leaves), tagging coverage, and suspect links reduces context switching and supports continuous monitoring.

## Implementation Notes

- Loads all requirements and tallies counts per requirement kind plus the overall total.
- Prints the counts in a simple aligned table followed by the suspect link total.
- Exits with a non-zero code when suspect links are present so CI jobs can fail fast.
- Default execution (no subcommand) invokes `req status` for quick feedback.

## Verification

- Running `req status` in a repository with mixed requirement kinds prints the table without panic.
- The total row matches the sum of individual kind counts.
- The command exits with status `1` when suspect links exist and `0` when none remain.
