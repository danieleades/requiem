# Status Dashboard CLI Command

## Statement

The tool shall provide a `req status` command that prints a simple table of requirement counts by kind and reports the number of suspect links.

## Rationale

Systems engineers need a quick snapshot before reviews, releases, or CI runs. A single command that surfaces totals, traceability gaps (roots/leaves), tagging coverage, and suspect links reduces context switching and supports continuous monitoring.

## Scope

The status view shall deliver an immediate health snapshot: total counts, breakdown by kind, and suspect link posture. It must favour legibility, fast startup, and CI-friendly behaviour so teams can wire it into pre-commit hooks and dashboards.

Presentation, table layout, and interaction guidance are captured in [SPC-003](./SPC-003.md).

## Verification

- Running the command in a mixed repository prints an accurate summary without failure.
- Totals reconcile with the counts in each requirement kind.
- Exit status signals whether suspect links remain so automation can act on the result.
