# CORE-SYS-004 Cycle Detection in Requirement Graph

## Statement

The tool shall construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from requirement parent-child relationships and detect any cycles, reporting them as errors.

## Rationale

Cycles in requirement hierarchies create logical inconsistencies where requirements depend on themselves, either directly or transitively. This violates the fundamental principle of hierarchical decomposition and makes traceability analysis impossible. Early detection of cycles prevents invalid requirement structures from being committed and ensures the requirement graph remains mathematically sound for analysis operations.

## Implementation Notes

- Graph constructed from parent links in requirement frontmatter
- Cycle detection using depth-first search or topological sort
- Cycles violate hierarchical requirement structure
- Report full cycle path (e.g., "USR-001 → SYS-002 → USR-001")

## Verification

- Tool detects direct cycles (A → B → A)
- Tool detects indirect cycles (A → B → C → A)
- Tool reports complete cycle path in error message
- Tool rejects loading requirements with cycles
- Valid DAGs load without errors
