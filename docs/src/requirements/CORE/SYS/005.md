# CORE-SYS-005 Suspect Link Detection

## Statement

The tool shall track "suspect links" by comparing the fingerprint stored in a child requirement against the current content fingerprint of its parent requirement.

## Rationale

When parent requirements change, child requirements may need updates to maintain consistency with the new parent specification. Suspect link detection automatically identifies which requirements need review after parent changes, preventing drift between parent and child requirements. This maintains traceability integrity without requiring manual tracking of all changes. The fingerprint-based approach scales efficiently to large requirement repositories.

## Implementation Notes

- A link is "suspect" when stored fingerprint ≠ current parent fingerprint
- Indicates parent has been modified since link was created/reviewed
- Child requirements with suspect links need manual review
- Fingerprints use SHA256 hash of parent content
- Tool computes current fingerprint on-demand for comparison

## Verification

- Tool correctly identifies suspect links after parent modifications
- Tool does not flag links when parent content unchanged
- Tool handles multiple parents (checks each independently)
- Fingerprint comparison is accurate and reliable
- Suspect links are clearly reported with child and parent HRIDs
