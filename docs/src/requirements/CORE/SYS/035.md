# CORE-SYS-035 MdBook Navigation Synchronization

## Statement

MdBook documentation that includes requirements shall keep its navigation synchronized with the full set of requirement files without manual editing of `SUMMARY.md`.

## Rationale

Manual curation of `SUMMARY.md` is brittle and time-consuming as requirements are added, moved, or removed. Automated alignment between the requirements corpus and MdBook navigation is necessary for publishing requirements reliably and keeping documentation trustworthy.

## Implementation Notes

- Requirements must be discoverable for inclusion without hand-maintaining `SUMMARY.md`.
- Navigation should reflect additions, moves, and removals of requirements so readers can browse the current set.
- Organization should stay consistent (by namespace/kind or chapter grouping) without requiring manual edits to MdBook scaffolding.
- The behavior should work in typical MdBook builds, including CI pipelines.

## Verification

- Building an MdBook that includes requirements produces navigation that lists all current requirements without manual `SUMMARY.md` edits.
- Adding, moving, or removing a requirement updates the generated navigation accordingly.
- Navigation grouping remains coherent after requirement structure changes.
- No manual `SUMMARY.md` maintenance is needed to keep navigation accurate.
