# CORE-USR-012 Lowercase Namespace Support

## Statement
The tool shall allow namespace segments in HRIDs to be lowercase while keeping requirement kinds uppercase, so teams can use human-friendly folder names without breaking HRID validity.

## Rationale
Repositories often prefer lowercase directory names for readability (`auth/api/SYS-001.md`). Enforcing uppercase-only namespaces forces awkward casing or manual renames and makes mixed tooling (e.g., docs generators) harder to integrate.

## Acceptance Criteria
- HRID validation permits lowercase namespace segments but still enforces uppercase kinds and numeric IDs.
- Path parsing/serialization preserves the original namespace casing when mapping between HRIDs and filesystem paths.
- Mixed-case namespaces round-trip: parsed HRIDs produce canonical paths matching the stored casing.
- CLI and MCP surfaces display namespaces in their original casing.
