# CORE-DFT-016 MdBook navigation drifts without manual SUMMARY updates

## Observation
MdBook navigation only follows entries in a hand-maintained `SUMMARY.md`, and the library offers no way to keep that file aligned with the evolving set of requirements.

## Evidence
- MdBook requires a static `SUMMARY.md` to declare all pages; requirements must be enumerated there manually to appear in navigation.
- The project currently provides no mechanism to regenerate or update `SUMMARY.md` when requirements are added, moved, or removed, so navigation easily falls out of sync.

## Impact
Publishing requirements with MdBook is brittle: every requirements change needs manual bookkeeping in `SUMMARY.md`, risking missing pages, broken navigation, and wasted maintenance time.

## Expected
MdBook builds that include requirements keep navigation accurate automatically—no manual `SUMMARY.md` edits are needed when requirements are added, moved, or removed. Navigation should stay synchronized with the current requirements set as described in CORE-SYS-035.
