# CORE-DFT-010 Cycle detection absent in graph loading

## Observation
Requirements are loaded without cycle detection; neither Directory::new nor the CLI validates the graph is acyclic.

## Evidence
- No cycle detection logic in req-core/src (grep for "cycle" yields none); Directory::new builds the tree without rejecting cycles.
- SYS-004/USR-004 require DAG enforcement with error reporting when cycles exist.

## Impact
Repositories containing parent cycles will load and operate, violating DAG requirements and potentially producing incorrect analyses.

## Expected
Detect and reject cycles during load/validation, reporting the full cycle path as an error as specified in SYS-004/USR-004.
