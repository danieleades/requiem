# CLI-DFT-009 Diagnose paths exits 0 on mismatches

## Observation
`req diagnose paths` reports path issues but always exits 0; SYS-023 requires a non-zero exit when mismatches are found for CI gating.

## Evidence
- req/src/cli/diagnose.rs: issues are printed but no exit status change when the list is non-empty.

## Impact
CI and scripts cannot rely on `req diagnose paths` to fail builds when paths drift from the configured mode, reducing its usefulness as a guardrail.

## Expected
Exit with non-zero status when any path mismatch is detected, while retaining the current reporting of expected vs actual paths.
