# CLI-DFT-001 Validate command missing structure/link checks

## Observation
`req validate` only reports path drift, stale HRIDs, and suspect links; structure checks and broken reference/cycle detection are TODO.

## Evidence
- crates/req/src/cli/validate.rs:151-190 leaves structure and link checks unimplemented.
- JSON/table outputs therefore never list YAML/duplicate/cycle/broken-parent issues.

## Impact
Repos with structural or link-integrity issues will pass validation and miss SPC-006 deliverables (comprehensive health report + actionable fixes).

## Expected
Implement full structure, path, link, and suspect checks with the outputs, exit codes, and safe auto-fix coverage described in SPC-006.
