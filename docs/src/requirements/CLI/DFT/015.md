# CLI-DFT-015 Status guidance references removed commands

## Observation
`req status` still instructs users to run `req add` when empty and to investigate suspects with `req suspect`, conflicting with SPC-003’s messaging for the renamed commands.

## Evidence
- req/src/cli/status.rs:55-57 prints “Create one with 'req add'.”
- req/src/cli/status.rs:170-176 prints “Run 'req suspect' to investigate suspect links.”

## Impact
Following the built-in guidance yields “unknown command” errors because `add`/`suspect` are not the supported entry points, confusing new users and diverging from the specified status experience.

## Expected
Align status hints with SPC-003: use the current `req create` empty-state prompt and direct suspect follow-ups to `req review`, dropping references to retired command names.
