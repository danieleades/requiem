# CLI-DFT-005 List command missing load spinner for large repos

## Observation
SPC-002 expects a progress spinner when loading >5k requirements; `req list` has no spinner or ASCII fallback.

## Evidence
- req/src/cli/list.rs contains no spinner/animation during load.

## Impact
Large repositories may appear hung during list; behaviour diverges from the specified UX for big datasets.

## Expected
Show the specified spinner (UTF-8 or ASCII fallback) while the graph loads for large datasets, stopping before the header renders.
