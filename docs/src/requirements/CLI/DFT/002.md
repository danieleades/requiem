# CLI-DFT-002 Status command missing git delta and exit behaviour

## Observation
`req status` reports path issues and exits 2 for path drift, and git deltas are stubbed as 0; the spec focuses on suspect-link health with deltas based on git history.

## Evidence
- req/src/cli/status.rs:73-180 sets delta to 0 and folds path issues into the health check/exit code, which SPC-003 does not specify.

## Impact
Status output and exit behaviour diverge from SPC-003, causing false CI failures and no visibility into requirement deltas.

## Expected
Compute deltas against the latest git commit per SPC-003 and align the output/exit codes to the suspect-link centric behaviour without extra path-issue gating unless the spec is updated.
