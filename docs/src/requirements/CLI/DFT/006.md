# CLI-DFT-006 Suspect/review JSON output missing timestamp and loader

## Observation
SPC-005 JSON sample includes a top-level `timestamp` and the command should show a spinner for large (>500) repositories; `req review` emits summary+links without timestamp and has no spinner.

## Evidence
- crates/req/src/cli/review.rs `output_json`/`output_ndjson` omit timestamp.
- No spinner/ASCII fallback in the command for large graphs.

## Impact
JSON is missing the prescribed field and large repos get no progress feedback, diverging from SPC-005.

## Expected
Include the timestamp field in JSON outputs and show the specified spinner during load for large repositories (UTF-8 or ASCII fallback).
