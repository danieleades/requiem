# CLI-DFT-014 Status panics on missing parent HRID

## Observation
`req status` panics when the repository contains a requirement that references a parent UUID with no corresponding requirement file/HRID.

## Evidence / Reproduction
1) Create `.req/config.toml` allowing namespaces and kinds (e.g., `allowed_kinds = ["USR", "SYS"]`).
2) Add `USR/001.md` with a parent UUID that has no file:
   ```

   created: 2025-11-25T12:00:00Z
   parents:
   - uuid: 99999999-9999-4999-8999-999999999999
     hrid: SYS-999

   # USR-001 Missing parent HRID
   Body
   ```
3) Run `cargo run --bin req -- -r <repo> status`.
4) Actual: process panics inside `Tree::suspect_links` due to a graph node without a registered HRID. Expected: graceful error describing the missing parent.

## Impact
Normal CLI usage can crash on malformed or partially missing requirements, breaking CI and confusing users.

## Expected
CLI commands (including `status`, `review`, and `validate`) should handle missing parents without panicking, returning a clear error and non-zero exit instead.
