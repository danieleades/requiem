# CLI-DFT-012 Create command lacks req add alias

## Observation
SYS-022 states the command was renamed from `req add` to `req create` with an alias maintained; the CLI only exposes `req create`.

## Evidence
- crates/req/src/cli.rs registers `Create(create::Command)` with no alias for `add`.
- No command module or alias wiring for `add` exists.

## Impact
Scripts and workflows using `req add` per SYS-022 cannot run; the implementation diverges from the documented interface.

## Expected
Provide a `req add` alias (or subcommand) that maps to `req create` while preserving behaviour and exit codes described in SYS-022.
