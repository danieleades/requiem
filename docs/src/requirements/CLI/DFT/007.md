# CLI-DFT-007 Validate command incomplete vs SYS-028/USR-010

## Observation
`req validate` currently only checks path drift, stale HRIDs, and suspect links; structure validation and broken reference/cycle detection are unimplemented, and JSON/table outputs therefore omit those issue types. Auto-fix is limited to paths/HRIDs.

## Evidence
- req/src/cli/validate.rs:151-190 leaves structure checks and most link checks as TODOs, so issues are never surfaced.

## Impact
Fails to deliver the comprehensive health check and outputs required by SYS-028 and USR-010; repositories with YAML/UUID/HRID duplicates or broken links will pass validation incorrectly.

## Expected
Implement the full set of structure, path, link, and suspect checks with reporting, exit codes, and safe auto-fix coverage described in SYS-028/USR-010.
