# CLI-SYS-024 Delete Requirement Command

## Statement

The tool shall provide a  command that safely deletes requirements with proper handling of parent-child relationships.

## Scope

This command addresses safe deletion of requirements from the repository. Three modes are supported:
1. **Error mode (default):** Refuse to delete if requirement has children
2. **Orphan mode (--orphan):** Delete requirement and unlink from children
3. **Cascade mode (--cascade):** Delete requirement and orphaned descendants

Smart cascade logic only deletes descendants that would become orphans (have no other parents), preventing unintended data loss in diamond dependency structures.

## Verification

- Command refuses to delete requirements with children unless flag provided
- --orphan flag removes requirement and unlinks from all children
- --cascade flag recursively deletes only descendants that would be orphaned
- --dry-run flag previews deletion without making changes
- --yes flag skips confirmation prompts
- Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (error), 130 (user cancelled)
- Confirmation prompt shows impact (number of children, descendants affected)
