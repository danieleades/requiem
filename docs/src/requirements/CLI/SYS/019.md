# CLI-SYS-019 Relationship Navigation Views

## Statement

The `req list` command shall expose relationship-focused views that make it easy to inspect parents, children, ancestors, and descendants of selected requirements.

## Rationale

Impact analysis and review prep require seeing the neighborhood around a requirement: upstream drivers, downstream implementations, and gaps such as missing children. Navigating that context inside the CLI keeps engineers in their workflow and avoids context switching.

## Scope

Relationship views shall help engineers understand impact, traceability gaps, and neighbourhood context without switching tools. The command should feel exploratory: easy to enter and exit a view, with clear signposting for depth and traversal.

Traversal behaviours, presentation conventions, and illustrative examples are provided in [SPC-002](./SPC-002.md).

## Verification

- Operators can pivot from a requirement to its parents or children with one flag.
- Depth controls constrain traversal so outputs stay legible.
- Views integrate with filters, ensuring the resulting set reflects both traversal and selection logic.
