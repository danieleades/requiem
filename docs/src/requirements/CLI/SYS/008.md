# CLI-SYS-008 Review Suspect Links CLI Command

## Statement

The tool shall provide a CLI command `req review` that lists and optionally accepts suspect links in the requirement graph.

## Scope

The review command exposes suspect relationships so engineers can review upstream changes and decide on remediation. The experience shall support both quick interactive scans and scripted checks in CI.

The command operates in two modes:
1. **List mode (default):** Display all suspect links
2. **Accept mode (--accept flag):** Update fingerprints to accept reviewed changes

Detailed interaction, messaging, and presentation are defined in [SPC-001](./SPC-001.md).

## Implementation Notes

- Command was previously named `suspect` (alias maintained for compatibility)
- Accept functionality consolidates the former `req accept` command
- Missing or deleted parent requirements are reported as suspect links with empty current fingerprint

## Verification

- Running the command surfaces every suspect link produced by the detection engine
- Output allows operators to identify the child and parent involved in each suspect relationship
- Missing or deleted parent requirements are reported as suspect links with empty current fingerprint
- --accept flag with child and parent arguments accepts a specific link
- --accept --all accepts all suspect links (with confirmation)
- Exit status communicates whether the repository still contains suspect links
