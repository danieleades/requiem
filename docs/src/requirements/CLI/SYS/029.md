# CLI-SYS-029 Kind Management Command

## Statement

The tool shall provide a 'req kind' command with subcommands for managing requirement kinds.

## Scope

This command provides explicit kind management as an alternative to config file editing:

Subcommands:
- req kind add KIND...     - Add one or more kinds to allowed list
- req kind remove KIND...  - Remove one or more kinds from allowed list  
- req kind list           - List all registered kinds

All operations update .req/config.toml allowed_kinds field.

## Verification

- 'req kind add' appends kinds to allowed_kinds in config
- 'req kind remove' removes kinds from allowed_kinds in config
- 'req kind remove' warns if requirements of that kind still exist
- 'req kind list' displays all registered kinds
- Commands update same config file used by manual editing
- Help text makes kind management discoverable
- Commands validate KIND format before adding
