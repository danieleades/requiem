# CLI-USR-009 Command Line Interface Lifecycle Management

## Statement

The tool shall provide CLI commands for managing the complete lifecycle of requirements (create, delete, move, rename) without requiring manual file editing.

## Rationale

Requirements engineers need to be able to manage requirements entirely through the command line for several reasons:
- **Safety:** Manual file editing is error-prone and can break metadata integrity
- **Efficiency:** Command-line operations are faster than opening editors
- **Automation:** Scripts and CI/CD pipelines need programmatic access
- **Consistency:** CLI commands enforce invariants and prevent data corruption

Without lifecycle management commands, users must manually edit files, track UUIDs, update parent links, move files, and maintain naming conventions - all of which are tedious and error-prone.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A command exists to safely delete requirements with proper handling of parent-child relationships
- A command exists to remove parent-child links without manual frontmatter editing
- A command exists to move requirements to new locations while maintaining HRID consistency
- A command exists to rename requirements (change HRID) and update all references
- All lifecycle commands include safety features (confirmations, dry-run, validation)
- Destructive operations require explicit confirmation or --yes flag
