# CLI-USR-011 Requirement Kind Management

## Statement

The tool shall provide CLI commands for managing requirement kinds (types) explicitly.

## Rationale

Requirement kinds (like USR, SYS, TST) are fundamental to the organization of a requirements repository. Users need to:
- **Discover:** See which kinds are allowed in the repository
- **Add:** Register new kinds without editing config files
- **Remove:** Deprecate kinds that are no longer needed
- **Validate:** Ensure requirements use recognized kinds

Currently, kind management requires direct config file editing, which is:
- **Less discoverable:** New users don't know about .req/config.toml
- **Error-prone:** Manual TOML editing can introduce syntax errors
- **Inconsistent:** Different from other CLI operations
- **Harder to script:** Requires TOML parsing in automation

Explicit kind management commands make the tool more approachable and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A command exists to add one or more requirement kinds
- A command exists to remove one or more requirement kinds
- A command exists to list all registered kinds
- Kind commands update the same config file that manual editing uses
- Kind validation respects the registered kinds list
- Help text and documentation make kind management discoverable
