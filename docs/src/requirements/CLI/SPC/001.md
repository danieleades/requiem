# CLI-SPC-001 Review Suspect Links CLI Specification

## Purpose

Provide a cohesive terminal experience that helps engineers notice, inspect, and resolve suspect links with confidence, whether they are investigating a single change or sweeping a backlog after a review cycle.

**Note:** This command was previously named `req suspect` with a separate `req accept` command. These have been unified into `req review` with `--accept` flag for a more coherent workflow.

## Experience Principles

- **Clarity first:** Highlight child → parent relationships in a consistent, column-aligned layout with subtle colour (when available) and unambiguous labels.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Offer terse summaries by default, then reveal fingerprints or paths only when users request extra context.
- **Guardrails:** Make irreversible actions deliberate through confirmations, dry-runs, and exit codes that play well with automation.
- **Speed:** Ensure commands feel instantaneous on the happy path (no unnecessary prompts, minimal chatter).

## Command Behaviours

### `req review` (List Mode - Default)

- Default output is a compact table: `CHILD  PARENT  STATUS`, sorted by child HRID. The `STATUS` column shows a short diagnosis (`fingerprint drift`, `parent missing`, etc.).
- `--detail` expands each row into a block that adds stored vs. current fingerprints plus the parent file path. Blocks are separated by thin dashed rules for scanability.
- `--format json|ndjson` mirrors the table data. JSON keys: `child`, `parent`, `status`, `stored_fingerprint`, `current_fingerprint`, `child_path`, `parent_path`.
- When no suspect links remain, print `✅ No suspect links detected.` and exit with `0`.
- When suspect links exist, exit with `2` and keep stderr quiet so table output is script-friendly.
- **Alias:** Command is also accessible as `req suspect` for backward compatibility (deprecated).

### `req review --accept <child> <parent>` (Accept Specific Link)

- Before writing, present a confirmation banner summarising the link:
  ```
  Reviewing: CHILD → PARENT
  Stored:    <hash>
  Current:   <hash>
  ```
- Prompt: `Accept this link? (y/N)` with uppercase default to reduce accidental confirmation. `--yes` skips the prompt.
- On success, print `Accepted CHILD ← PARENT` in green (fallback to plain text when colours are disabled).
- If the link is not suspect, warn: `No changes: link already up-to-date.` and exit with `0`.
- Unknown relationships fail with exit code `64` (usage error) and message `Unable to find parent PARENT for child CHILD`.
- **Note:** This replaces the previous `req accept <child> <parent>` command.

### `req review --accept --all` (Accept All Suspect Links)

- Shows a summary of all suspect links to be accepted:
  ```
  Found 24 suspect links across 10 files
  ```
- Confirmation prompt: `Accept all 24 suspect links? (y/N)`
- `--yes` flag skips the confirmation prompt
- `--dry-run` shows what would be accepted without making changes
- During apply, stream progress as `Updating CHILD ← PARENT`. On completion, show a compact recap (`Links updated: 24 | Files touched: 10 | Duration: 0.9s`).
- Exit codes: `0` on success, `2` if suspect links remain (e.g., in dry-run mode), `70` for IO failures, `130` for user cancellation.
- **Note:** This replaces the previous `req accept --all` command.

## Accessibility & Ergonomics

- Follow no-colour environment variables (`NO_COLOR`, `CLICOLOR=0`) and provide readable monochrome output.
- Table layouts use spaces, not tabs, so alignment is predictable across shells.
- Prompts treat EOF (Ctrl-D) as “cancel” and exit with code `130`, mirroring interrupted commands.
- Messages avoid gendered language, use sentence case, and keep line width ≤ 80 characters.

## Empty-State & Error Messaging

- Empty preview (`req accept --all --dry-run` with nothing to do) returns: `Nothing to update. All suspect links are already accepted.` plus exit `0`.
- If the graph cannot be loaded, display `Unable to read requirements. See logs above.` and exit `70`.
- Validation errors refer to HRIDs, not internal UUIDs, so engineers can locate files quickly.
