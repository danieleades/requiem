# CLI-SPC-004 Directory Structure Modes Specification

## Purpose

Help maintainers confidently choose and manage the directory mode that fits their organisation—without breaking existing HRIDs—through clear configuration touchpoints, status feedback, and migration guidance.

## Configuration UX

- `req config show` displays the current mode as `subfolders_are_namespaces: false (filename mode)` or `true (path mode)`.
- Changing the setting through `req config set subfolders_are_namespaces true` yields:
  ```
  Directory mode: path-based
  • Filenames inside namespace folders should contain KIND-ID (e.g., USR/003.md).
  • You will need to manually reorganize existing files to match the new structure.
  ```
- When toggling back to filename mode, surface a reminder: `Namespaces will no longer be inferred from folders.` plus a link to docs (`See docs/src/requirements/SPC-004.md#migration-guide`).

## Creation & Editing Flow

- When in path-based mode and the user creates a requirement without a namespace folder, prompt:
  ```
  Destination folder 'requirements/USR/' not found.
  Create it now? (Y/n)
  ```
  Accept uppercase `Y` as default. Declining falls back to filename mode behaviour for that operation.
- Saving a requirement checks the inferred HRID and, if mismatched, prints:
  `Mismatch: path implies namespace 'system/auth', but HRID is 'payment-USR-002'.`
  Provide two remedies: `1) Rename the file`, `2) Update YAML hrid`. Exit `64`.

## Migration Guide

- When switching between filename-based and path-based modes, existing files can be automatically reorganized using the sync command.
- Documentation snippet (this spec) includes a checklist:
  1. Commit a clean working tree.
  2. Enable the desired directory mode with `req config set subfolders_are_namespaces true/false`.
  3. Run `req sync check --what paths` to see which files need reorganization.
  4. Run `req sync fix --what paths --dry-run` to preview the changes.
  5. Run `req sync fix --what paths` to move files with confirmation, or add `--yes` to skip confirmation.

## Feedback & Diagnostics

- `req status` should flag inconsistent files as a warning: `⚠️ 3 files violate directory mode expectations (run 'req sync check --what paths').`
- `req sync` or `req sync check --what paths` lists all misplaced files with current and expected paths, plus fix instructions.
- Error messages mention both the problematic path and the expected pattern (e.g., `Expected 'KIND-ID.md', found 'somefile.txt'`).

## Accessibility Considerations

- All instructions use sentence case, short paragraphs, and 80-column wraps.
- Prompts mirror the `[Y/n]` convention so screen readers announce defaults properly.
- When terminal colour is disabled, swap coloured bullets for ASCII equivalents (`*`).
