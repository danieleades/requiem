# CLI-SPC-003 Status Dashboard CLI Specification

## Purpose

Deliver an at-a-glance health report that fits in a single terminal viewport, gives teams confidence before merges, and doubles as a CI gate when traceability drifts.

**Note on Future Integration:** This command will continue to exist as a quick dashboard, but its functionality may be supplemented or partially absorbed by the unified `req validate` command (see SPC-006). The status command focuses on quick counts and summaries, while validate provides comprehensive health checking with detailed issue reporting.

## Layout

```
req status

Requirement counts
──────────────────
Kind   Count  Δ
USR    12     +1
SYS    20      0
TST     5     -1
Total  37

Suspect links: 3 ⚠️
```

- Section headers use sentence case and a thin horizontal rule beneath them.
- The delta column (`Δ`) shows the change relative to the most recent git commit when available; fallback is `–`.
- Colour accents:
  - Positive delta → green `+`.
  - Negative delta → amber `-`.
  - Zero delta → dimmed `0`.
- When no suspect links remain, render `Suspect links: 0 ✅`. When they exist, surface a prompt: `Run 'req review' to investigate.`

## Behaviour

- Default command (`req status`) runs instantly with no prompts and exits `0` when there are zero suspect links, `2` when suspect links exist, and `70` on IO failures.
- `--output json` returns:
  ```json
  {
    "kinds": [{"kind":"USR","count":12,"delta":1}, ...],
    "total": {"count":37,"delta":0},
    "suspect_links": 3
  }
  ```
- `--quiet` prints only the total count and suspect link number on one line (`total=37 suspect=3`).

## Accessibility & Ergonomics

- Detect narrow terminals (<60 columns) and switch to stacked output where each kind is printed as `USR: 12 (Δ +1)`.
- Avoid relying on colour: include symbols (`+`, `-`, `0`, `⚠️`, `✅`) with text alternatives.
- Respect `NO_COLOR` and `CLICOLOR=0` to disable ANSI escapes.
- Keep runtime under 200 ms for repositories under 1k requirements; display a spinner with `Analysing requirements…` if longer.

## Messaging

- On suspect links: `3 suspect links detected. Review with 'req review'.`
- On data load issues: `Unable to compute status. See errors above.` (exit `70`).
- When no requirements exist: `No requirements found yet. Create one with 'req create'.` plus exit `0`.
