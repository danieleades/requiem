# Enhanced Suspect Command Ergonomics

## Purpose

Extend the `req suspect` command with context-rich output, filtering capabilities, and interactive workflows that help engineers efficiently triage, understand, and resolve suspect links across repositories of any size.

## Experience Principles

- **Context over cryptography:** Surface requirement titles, paths, and modification context instead of expecting users to decode fingerprint hashes.
- **Triage efficiency:** Provide filtering, grouping, and statistics so engineers can prioritise reviews by impact (most affected parents, specific requirement types, etc.).
- **Scriptable depth:** Balance human-readable defaults with machine-parseable formats that integrate into CI pipelines and review tracking systems.
- **Progressive complexity:** Keep the default path simple; reveal advanced features through discoverable flags rather than overwhelming the initial experience.

## Enhanced Default Output

Current baseline from SPC-001 remains the foundation. This specification extends it with contextual enrichment:

```
Suspect Links Found: 3

CHILD       PARENT      TITLE (CHILD → PARENT)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TST-002  →  USR-001     Test case for login → User authentication
SYS-005  →  USR-001     System integration → User authentication
TST-003  →  SYS-005     Integration test → System integration

Run 'req suspect --detail' for paths and fingerprints
Run 'req accept --all --apply' to accept all changes
```

**Changes from baseline:**
- Add title columns showing `CHILD_TITLE → PARENT_TITLE` for semantic context
- Include helpful footer with next-step commands
- Maintain clean column alignment with proper padding
- Show count in header (`Found: N`)

## Extended Detail Mode

Enhance `--detail` output with file paths, timestamps, and actionable commands:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Suspect Link #1 of 3

  CHILD:   TST-002  Test case for login functionality
           Path:     ./tests/TST-002.md

  PARENT:  USR-001  User authentication requirements
           Path:     ./requirements/USR-001.md

  REASON:  Parent content changed (fingerprint drift)

  STORED:  2520e9b3a2ce93d942f5288ffebec2fbdbf877367edd9968a0ae930b343dbac7
  CURRENT: 2836f44e05c344dff2764275e0645829c2ef88c073f0d0062bc625f515d2d577

  ACTIONS:
    req accept TST-002 USR-001 --apply
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Additions:**
- Requirement titles in full
- File paths for both child and parent
- Numbered suspects (`#1 of 3`) for orientation
- Concrete action commands
- Clear section separators using box-drawing characters

## Filtering Capabilities

### By Requirement Identifiers

- `--child <HRID>` filters to suspects where the given requirement is the child
- `--parent <HRID>` filters to suspects where the given requirement is the parent
- `--kind <KIND>` filters by child requirement kind

**Example:**
```bash
req suspect --parent USR-001
# Shows only suspects where USR-001 is the parent

req suspect --kind TST
# Shows only test requirements with suspect parent links
```

### Output Grouping

- `--group-by <FIELD>` organises output hierarchically
- Supported fields: `parent`, `child`, `none` (default)

**Example with `--group-by parent`:**
```
Suspect Links by Parent (2 parents, 5 links total)

USR-001 (User authentication requirements)
├─ TST-002  Test case for login
├─ TST-003  Test case for logout
└─ SYS-005  System component integration

SYS-005 (System integration)
├─ TST-010  Integration test alpha
└─ TST-011  Integration test beta
```

Tree formatting uses UTF-8 box characters with ASCII fallback (`--ascii` or when terminal lacks support).

## Summary Statistics

- `--stats` displays aggregate information before the table
- Helps teams understand review scope and prioritise high-impact parents

**Example:**
```
Suspect Link Statistics

Total suspect links:       12
Unique parents affected:    5
Unique children affected:  12

By child requirement kind:
  TST  →  *     7 links
  SYS  →  *     3 links
  USR  →  *     2 links

Most affected parents:
  USR-001  (5 children)
  SYS-003  (3 children)
  SYS-005  (2 children)
```

When combined with `--format json`, include a `summary` object at the root level mirroring this data.

## Quiet Mode for Scripting

- `--quiet` outputs minimal, parseable data: one line per suspect, space-separated HRIDs
- No colours, no headers, no footers
- Exit codes remain unchanged (0 when clean, 2 when suspects exist)

**Example:**
```bash
req suspect --quiet
TST-002 USR-001
SYS-005 USR-001
TST-003 SYS-005
```

Enables shell pipelines:
```bash
req suspect --quiet | while read child parent; do
  echo "Reviewing $child → $parent"
done
```

## Enhanced JSON Output

Extend JSON format to include titles, paths, and summary statistics:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T20:45:00Z",
  "summary": {
    "total_count": 3,
    "unique_parents": 2,
    "unique_children": 3,
    "by_kind": {
      "TST": 2,
      "SYS": 1
    }
  },
  "links": [
    {
      "child": {
        "hrid": "TST-002",
        "title": "Test case for login",
        "path": "./tests/TST-002.md",
        "kind": "TST"
      },
      "parent": {
        "hrid": "USR-001",
        "title": "User authentication",
        "path": "./requirements/USR-001.md",
        "kind": "USR"
      },
      "status": "fingerprint drift",
      "stored_fingerprint": "2520e9b3a2ce...",
      "current_fingerprint": "2836f44e05c3..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Accessibility & Performance

- Maintain colour detection and `NO_COLOR` compliance from SPC-001
- For repositories >500 requirements, show a progress indicator during graph load: `Analysing suspect links…` with spinner (⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏) or ASCII fallback (`...`)
- Spinner disappears before output begins; never mix spinner and table on the same line
- Keep default (no filters) execution under 500ms for repositories <1k requirements

## Messaging & Error Handling

- Unknown filter values exit `64` with message: `Unknown requirement: <HRID>. Check 'req list' for available identifiers.`
- Invalid `--group-by` values exit `64` with message: `Invalid group field '<value>'. Use: parent, child, or none.`
- Empty filter results print: `No suspect links matched the specified filters.` and exit `0`
- Maintain existing empty-state messaging from SPC-001 when no suspects exist at all

## Interaction with Other Commands

- `req status` surfaces suspect counts; `req suspect` provides the investigation layer
- `req accept` consumes the HRIDs displayed by `req suspect`, enabling a natural workflow progression
- JSON output format should be consumable by external tracking systems and CI reporting tools
