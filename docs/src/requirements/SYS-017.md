# Requirements Listing CLI Command

## Statement

The tool shall provide a `req list` command that enumerates requirements with key metadata in a tabular format.

## Rationale

Engineers need a quick inventory of requirements without opening files individually. A built-in listing command removes dependency on custom scripts, aligns with other CLI workflows, and enables rapid inspection before commits, during reviews, or in CI checks.

## Scope

The listing capability shall surface requirement essentials at a glance and adapt to different contexts (quick overviews, targeted inspections, machine-readable exports). It must remain approachable in the terminal while giving advanced users room to slice, filter, and explore.

Detailed interaction design, column sets, and output patterns are specified in [SPC-002](./SPC-002.md).

## Verification

- Invoking the command displays requirement rows with the agreed summary fields by default.
- Users can narrow the listing to specific requirements or export structured data without editing files manually.
- Command exits communicate success or failure to callers and automation.
