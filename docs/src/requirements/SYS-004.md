# Cycle Detection in Requirement Graph

## Statement

The tool shall construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from requirement parent-child relationships and detect any cycles, reporting them as errors.

## Implementation Notes

- Graph constructed from parent links in requirement frontmatter
- Cycle detection using depth-first search or topological sort
- Cycles violate hierarchical requirement structure
- Report full cycle path (e.g., "USR-001 → SYS-002 → USR-001")

## Verification

- Tool detects direct cycles (A → B → A)
- Tool detects indirect cycles (A → B → C → A)
- Tool reports complete cycle path in error message
- Tool rejects loading requirements with cycles
- Valid DAGs load without errors
