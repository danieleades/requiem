# Accept All Suspect Links in Bulk

## Statement

The tool shall provide a CLI command `req accept --all` that accepts all suspect links in bulk by updating all suspect fingerprints.

## Implementation Notes

Command `req accept --all` shall:
- Scan entire requirement graph for suspect links
- Update all suspect fingerprints to match current parent fingerprints
- Write updates to all affected requirement files
- Provide summary of how many links were updated
- Support `--dry-run` flag to preview without applying changes
- Require confirmation prompt unless `--force` flag provided
- Report all updated child/parent pairs

## Verification

- Command updates all suspect links found in repository
- All requirement files with suspect links are modified
- Summary shows accurate count of updated links
- Dry-run mode shows what would change without modifying files
- Confirmation prompt prevents accidental bulk changes
- Force flag bypasses confirmation for automation
- All updated links no longer appear as suspect after command
