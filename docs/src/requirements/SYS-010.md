# SYS-010 Accept All Suspect Links in Bulk

## Statement

The tool shall provide a CLI command `req accept --all` that accepts all suspect links in bulk by updating all suspect fingerprints.

## Scope

Bulk acceptance supports maintenance workflows where many suspect links have already been reviewed outside the tool. The experience shall emphasise transparency and safeguards so that wide-reaching updates remain intentional.

User journey details, confirmation patterns, and reporting expectations are documented in [SPC-001](./SPC-001.md).

## Verification

- Running the command updates every outstanding suspect link when the operator confirms the action.
- The command communicates how many files were touched and whether any suspect links remain.
- Operators can discover the impact before committing to write operations.
