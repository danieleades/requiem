# Accept Individual Suspect Links

## Statement

The tool shall provide a CLI command `req accept` that accepts suspect links individually by updating stored fingerprints after manual review.

## Scope

This capability gives reviewers a precise way to acknowledge that a single parent change has been evaluated. The command shall guide the reviewer through targeting one child/parent pair, confirm the outcome, and help prevent accidental acceptance of non-suspect links.

Interaction flow, argument semantics, and messaging live in [SPC-001](./SPC-001.md).

## Verification

- Successful use of the command clears the suspect status for the chosen link.
- Files modified by the command retain their other metadata and content.
- Attempts to accept a non-existent or non-suspect link surface clear errors to the caller.
