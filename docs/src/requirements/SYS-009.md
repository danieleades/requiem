# Accept Individual Suspect Links

## Statement

The tool shall provide a CLI command `req accept` that accepts suspect links individually by updating stored fingerprints after manual review.

## Implementation Notes

Command `req accept <child> <parent>` shall:
- Accept child HRID and parent HRID as arguments
- Update stored fingerprint in child to match parent's current fingerprint
- Write updated fingerprint back to child requirement file
- Signal that child has been reviewed and remains valid
- Report error if link is not suspect (already up-to-date)
- Report error if parent link doesn't exist in child

## Verification

- Command updates fingerprint for specified suspect link
- Updated child requirement file contains new fingerprint
- Link is no longer reported as suspect after accept
- Command errors appropriately for non-suspect links
- Command errors appropriately for non-existent links
- File modification preserves all other metadata and content
