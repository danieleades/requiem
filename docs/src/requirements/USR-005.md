# Static Site Generator Integration

## Statement

Requirements shall integrate seamlessly with documentation tools like MdBook and Sphinx, allowing requirements to be embedded directly into user documentation and technical specifications.

## Rationale

Integration with static site generators enables:
- Requirements as part of living documentation
- Single source of truth for requirements and docs
- Automatic documentation generation from requirements
- Familiar tools for developers and technical writers
- Beautiful, searchable requirement documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Requirement files are valid Markdown compatible with MdBook
- Requirement files are compatible with Sphinx + MyST Parser
- Requirements can be included/transcluded into documentation
- Metadata (YAML frontmatter) doesn't break rendering
- Generated documentation maintains requirement traceability links
