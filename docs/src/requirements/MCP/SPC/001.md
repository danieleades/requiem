# MCP-SPC-001 Tool Description Standards

## Statement
Tool descriptions shall follow consistent wording that clearly communicates intent and implementation status to MCP clients.

## Standards
1) Start with a clear verb indicating the action (List, Get, Search, Create, etc.).
2) Describe the primary purpose in 1-2 sentences.
3) Include "not implemented" or "stub" marker for incomplete tools.
4) Avoid overly technical jargon that might confuse agents.
