# MCP-DFT-001 Kind metadata not exposed via MCP

## Observation
The MCP server exposes only bare kind identifiers; it does not surface kind metadata (description, typical usage, example HRIDs) described in MCP-SYS-002 / MCP-SPC-003.

## Evidence
- `crates/req-mcp/src/server.rs` provides `list_requirement_kinds` with a `Vec<String>` and no metadata payload.
- There is no tool or response field carrying per-kind description/usage/example metadata.

## Impact
Agents cannot understand the semantics of each kind from the MCP interface alone, violating the self-documenting API goal and the kind metadata requirements.

## Expected
Expose kind metadata (description, typical_usage, example_hrids) via the MCP API per MCP-SYS-002 / MCP-SPC-003, e.g., by enriching `list_requirement_kinds` or adding a dedicated tool.
