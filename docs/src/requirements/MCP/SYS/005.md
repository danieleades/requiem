# MCP-SYS-005 Live directory reload

## Statement
The MCP server shall detect filesystem changes (add/modify/delete requirement files or config) and reload the directory so tool results reflect the current repository state without restarting the server.

## Rationale
Editors and automations frequently change requirements while an MCP client session remains open. Without live reload, agents receive stale data, miss new requirements, or operate on deleted links, undermining trust in the MCP output.

## Verification
- Creating, editing, or deleting a requirement while the server is running is reflected in subsequent tool calls without restarting.
- Changes to `.req/config.toml` are applied to tool behaviour after reload.
- Reloading is reliable and does not crash or leak state when files are temporarily inconsistent.
