# MdBook

Requiem can be used alongside MdBook. The only requirement is that files which are not requirements do not use filenames which have the same syntax as a Requiem human readable ID (HRID).

## Building the Example

first install MdBook:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

then build the book

```sh
mdbook build
```
